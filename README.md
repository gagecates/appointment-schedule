# appointment-schedule

This is a React/Firebase application that allows users to sign up and begin scheduling appointments with other users. 

Boy was this a fun project. I really wish I had some more time to spend on it. Regardless, it was very enjoyable diving into Firebase with little to no prior experience. I really love how easy it can make things once you get the hang of it...

The app is currently deployed and viewable here: [Pocket RN](https://pocket-rn-7b032.web.app/)

## Run Locally

1. cd to the project root directory.
2. cd to the hosting directory and install dependencies:
```
    npm i
```
5. Run React project on local server.
```
    npm start
```


There are currently some generic users in the databse that you can use to set up appointments with.

## App Operation:

1. To begin, sign up to create an account. 

2. You will then be presented with your home page where you can view any scheduled appointments as well as any appointment requests.

3. To create a new appointment request, click on the "Add Appointment" button. This will bring you to a page to view all registered users.

4. You can then chose a user to create an appoitment request with. 

5. Enter the appointment details and click submit. 

6. That user will then recieve a new appointment request when logged in. If they accept the request, the new appointment will be viewable on your home page.
